# testish
`Testish` is a minimalistic E2E testing framework powered by `Node.js` among with `selenium-webdriver` `chromedriver`, `Mocha` and `Chai`.

It provides you basic abstractions, utils, and a tests runner. The only thing left, is to write your tests and run them with `testish`!

# The Idea
The main idea behind this framework is to provide the ability to setup your `E2E` tests as fast as possible with `Node.js` stack. Using `Node.js` as your main stack for E2E tests has some great advantages. First of all, it's easy to support. Frontend developers can easily cover their own features with UI tests, and there is no need to learn Java or Python for writing tests.
